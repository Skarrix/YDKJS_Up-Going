Ch1 quick overview of what you'll want to learn+practice to get into programming

Code
  Language=syntax. code=set of instructions in a given language.
  Saved in txt file.

  Statement: group of words/numbers/operators performing specific task.
             Conclude with ;
             Made up of 1 or more Expressions
  a=b*2; where a/b = variables, 2 = literal value (stands alone), =/* = operators.

  Variables: holds values

  Operators: Performs actions with values and variables

  Expressions: a reference to variable or value, or set thereof, combined    with         operators.
              For a = b * 2
              2 = literal value expression
              b = variable expression (retrieve current value)
              b * 2 = arithmetic expression (execute multiplication), also 'expression statement' (stands alone, not useful bc does nothing with output)
              a = b * 2 = assignment expression (assign result of b*2 exp to variable a)
              alert( a ); = call expression statement

Compiler/Interpreter: runs/executes/compiles code into commands
  Interpreting code: top to bottom, line by line, each time program runs
  Compiling: translation done ahead of time

Practice on Dev Console

  Output
    a=21;
    b=a*2;
    console.log(b);
   Where
      console.log(..) = print text (aka output) to user
      log(b) = Function (log=print to console)
      console. = object reference where log(..) is located
   Another Output ex
      alert(..);

  Input
    most common: form elements (txt boxes) for user to type into, Js then used to read values into programs variables.
    Alternatively: promt(..) function
      age = prompt("Please tell me your age:");
      console.log(age);
      29
     Where
      age = variable where input is stored
      console.log(age) = outputs variable stored in age
      prompt(..) = creates pop-up prompt to enter variable
      "Please tell me your age:" = message printed in popup
