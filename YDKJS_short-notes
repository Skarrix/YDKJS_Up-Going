  <, >, <=, =>
  &&, ||

  values holding other values at 'properties'
  expresses compound conditionals
                              Ex. console.log()

  specific named locations
                              Ex. obj.a

Functions
  For code to be reused/'called' multiple times
  or
  Organization, to make logic clearer by collecting related code in named locations
                            Ex. function printAmount(amt) -given parameter
                                function formatAmount()   -returns value
